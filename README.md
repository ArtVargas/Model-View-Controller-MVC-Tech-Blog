# Model-View-Controller-MVC-Tech-Blog
Challenge this week is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts. app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package. This application was created in order to properly demonstrate a CMS-style blog site where many developers for example could publish various blog posts and comment on each post. There was much work that went into the implementation of various structures such as the inclusion og Handlebars.js being used as the templating language and also having Sequelize being the ORM. There was also an inclusion of having express-session as a npm package in regards to this project. This project stands on its own by absolutely being a first time attempt at really implementing the various knowledge and skills to create a full technical Tech blog that allowed much accessibility for blog publication. The creation of the tech blog proved to be quite challenging and very time consuming especially with new information having to be practiced and implemented into the blog with various trial and error. Much practice can be perfected into making the MVC tech blog into a much more sustained and technically sound application that utilizes all the various information needed in order to construct all the technical capabilities which truly provides users with exceptional usage and implementation for their blog posts.
